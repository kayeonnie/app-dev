**MasterChef Australia**

This is one of my favorite programs that I've just recently watch because before I watched the American version ones but it's kind of interesting for me that I've give a try for the Australian (alongside Canadian version ones) since 2021. It's very different on this version where it was the first nation (apart from the originated nation United Kingdom) to have their own version of the long-running MasterChef franchise since 2009 and it expands within other nations across the globe where the aspiring and potential folks that have a desire to launch their culinary careers came from different backgrounds and occupations before they explored that they're meant to be on this culinary industry.

They competed for the coveted white aprons so that they will competed on the main event which is the MasterChef kitchen that have a lot of challenges that these future cooks will faced by the panel of judges (that were also co-program hosts of their respective MasterChef franchise for some). That includes Mystery Box, Invention Test, Team Challenge, Pressure Test, Immunity Challenge and All-In Elimination. Mystery Box Challenge is about whatever it's on the box then they must use those at least 1 ingredient or all of these for the most, sometimes that they can't have access to the full pantry and garden for some of the said challenges but there's some challenges will only contain an object such as picture frame of your childhood memories, nature, clouds and rubik's cube where we could use it as our inspiration to cook a dish whatever we want and could access to the full pantry and garden for the most like what happened on the 2020: Back To Win season. Invention Test ones is that we must cook a dish that must be in an unconventional format which we didn't yet to showcase to everyone. Team Challenges is a challenge where they split up into at least 2 teams where they must cook a lot of dishes for both the judges and visitors who are customers, sometimes that it might also do a team challenges in a relay format where only one cook from their team cook then would pass the baton to the next one till the last ones finishes the work. Pressure Test is for the cooks who lost in Team Challenges or have least impressive performance on the Mystery Box Challenges where they must replicate the dishes set by the guests or the panel of judges either
