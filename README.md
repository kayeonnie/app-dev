**MasterChef Australia**

This is one of my favorite programs that I've just recently watch because before I watched the American version ones but it's kind of interesting for me that I've give a try for the Australian (alongside Canadian version ones) since 2021. It's very different on this version where it was the first nation (apart from the originated nation United Kingdom) to have their own version of the long-running MasterChef franchise since 2009 and it expands within other nations across the globe where the aspiring and potential folks that have a desire to launch their culinary careers came from different backgrounds and occupations before they explored that they're meant to be on this culinary industry.

They competed for the coveted white aprons so that they will competed on the main event which is the MasterChef kitchen that have a lot of challenges that these future cooks will faced by the panel of judges (that were also co-program hosts of their respective MasterChef franchise for some). That includes Mystery Box, Invention Test, Team Challenge, Pressure Test, Immunity Challenge and All-In Elimination. Mystery Box ones is about whatever it's on the box then they must use those at least 1 ingredient or all of these for the most, they can't have access to the full pantry and garden for some of the said challenges
